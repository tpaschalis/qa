# 11. Container With Most Water

Medium 

Given n non-negative integers `a1, a2, ..., an` , where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Note: You may not slant the container and n is at least 2.

Brute force solution is O(nÂ²), as we pass through every possible pair.

A one-pass O(n) solution is to begin with the leftmost and rightmost columns. Since the total volume of 'water'/area is bounded by the lower value in the leftmost-rightmost pair, we move that index towards the center. Keep doing that until the left and right barriers meet each other, and you're done!
